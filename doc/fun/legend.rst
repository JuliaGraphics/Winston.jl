legend
========

.. function:: legend([p], lab [,x, y], ...)
              legend([p], lab [,xy], ...)

   Add a legend to plot ``p`` (or to the current plot if ``p`` is not specified),
   assigning the labels defined in the vector of strings ``lab`` to the components
   of the plot (labels must follow the order of the components).
   
   The position of the legend is defined by the coordinates ``x``, ``y``,
   which can be given separately or in a vector or tuple.
